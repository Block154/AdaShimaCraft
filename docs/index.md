# Hello!

This is the site to help you around with some information about the AdaShimaCraft server and such.
I'm planning on writing & including some images about how the mc server is doing as well in the [Story](Story/Story.md) tab.

!!! note

    The server has a modpack that is mainly focused on optimization mods (which means your Minecraft will run smoother), but it also includes Simple Voice Chat and other stuff for fun. The modpack is undergoing review on Modrinth, by which after that I will explain how you can very easily install it. <br>
    For now, you can just join the server in a vanilla client, running 1.20.4 .

# Main info:

- Server IP: **89.168.61.51:22565** *(put this inside of minecraft when you click the `New Server` button)*
- Version: Minecraft (Fabric (not obligatory)) **1.20.4**
- The online worldmap (Dynmap): [http://89.168.61.51:8123/](http://89.168.61.51:8123/)
- The upcoming modpack: **(insert link)**

# Other goals
1. write in the [Story](Story/Story.md) tab
2. explain why each mod is used in the modpack
